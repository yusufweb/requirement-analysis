## What is Requirement Analysis?

<p>The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. It is a process used to determine the needs and the expecations of a new product. It involves communicating with stakeholders and end-users of teh product to define expectations, resolve conflict and document all the requirement</p>

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. Clarifies Expectations and Goals
Requirement analysis is essential for establishing a clear and mutual understanding between all stakeholders involved in a project. It defines what the software is expected to do and aligns the development process with business objectives.

2. Reduces Cost and Rework
Identifying and resolving requirement issues early in the software development life cycle is far less expensive than addressing them later during development or after deployment. Requirement analysis helps detect potential flaws, inconsistencies, or missing elements before any code is written.

3. Improves Quality and User Satisfaction
A well-conducted requirement analysis ensures that the final software product meets user needs and expectations. By involving users and stakeholders early in the process, developers can gain valuable insights into the real-world problems the software aims to solve. This leads to the creation of features that are both relevant and user-friendly. As a result, the software is more likely to achieve high levels of usability, functionality, and customer satisfaction, while also supporting effective testing and validation processes.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.

1. Requirement gathering - Interviewing, Survey, Workshop
2. Requirement Elicitation - Brainstorming, Focus Group and Prototyping
3. Requirement Documentation - Requirement Specification Document, User story and Use cases
4. Requirement Analysis -
   - Requirement Priotization based on their importance
   - Feasibilty Analysis in terms of technical, financial and time constrainst
   - Modeling: Create Model(e.g data flow diagrams, entity relatioship digrams) to visualize and analyze the requirment.
5. Requirement Validation: Review and Approval, Acceptance Criteria and Traceablity.
